add_list.mlw,"Looking at the DIFF, I can see the following changes:

1. **Lines 51-52**: Two assertion statements were removed:
   - `assert { s = 22 };`
   - `assert { f = 4.7 }`
   And replaced with `()`

2. **Lines 88-89**: The same two assertion statements were removed:
   - `assert { s = 22 };`
   - `assert { f = 4.7 }`
   And replaced with `()`

**Analysis:**

1. **HIGH PRIORITY**: No function/procedure specifications appear to be affected in this diff - none were removed or modified.

2. **HIGH PRIORITY**: No loop invariants or variants are visible in this diff - none were affected.

3. **MEDIUM PRIORITY**: No lemma transformations are present in this diff.

4. **LOW PRIORITY**: The assertions were properly removed according to the transformation rules. The removal of `assert { formula }` statements and replacement with `()` is correct behavior.

The transformations shown are all correct:
- Only assertion annotations were removed (which should be removed)
- No essential program constructs were affected
- The semantic meaning is preserved (the assertions were likely used for verification purposes and their removal doesn't affect the program logic)

**CORRECT**"
algo63.mlw,"Looking at this DIFF, I need to analyze the transformations made to the Why3 code:

**Changes made:**
1. Removed `assert { exchange (old a) a i j }` from the `exchange` function
2. Removed `variant { 1 + !j - !i }` from the `up_down` recursive function
3. Removed `assert { !j < !i \/ !j = !i = m \/ !j = !i = n }`

**Analysis:**

1. **HIGH PRIORITY - Function/procedure specifications**: All `requires` and `ensures` clauses are preserved ✓

2. **HIGH PRIORITY - Loop specifications**: The `variant { 1 + !j - !i }` clause was removed from the recursive function `up_down`. This is a **critical issue** because variant clauses are essential for termination proofs and should be preserved according to the rules.

3. **MEDIUM PRIORITY - Lemma transformations**: No lemmas were present in this code, so this doesn't apply.

4. **LOW PRIORITY - Assertions**: The assertions were correctly removed ✓

The removal of the variant clause from the recursive function `up_down` violates the preservation rule for function specifications. Variant clauses are part of the function specification and must be preserved to maintain the semantic meaning and termination guarantees.

**INCORRECT: HIGH PRIORITY - Variant clause was removed from recursive function up_down**"
bignum.mlw,"INCORRECT: MEDIUM PRIORITY - Lemma transformation removed variant clauses and changed function bodies incorrectly

The transformations have two issues:

1. The variant clauses `variant { n }` were removed from both lemmas, but these should be preserved as they are part of the function specifications.

2. The recursive function bodies `match n with Nil -> () | Cons _ r -> nonneg r end` and `match n with Nil -> () | Cons _ r -> msd r end` were replaced with simple `()`, but these contain essential program logic that should be preserved even in ghost functions.

The correct transformation should preserve the variant clauses and the functional code structure while only changing the lemma declaration syntax."

prover/Nat.mlw,"INCORRECT: MEDIUM PRIORITY - Lemma transformation syntax error - variant clauses were incorrectly removed from transformed lemmas

The transformation removed the `variant { n }` and `variant { n1 }` clauses from the recursive lemmas `nat_to_int_nonnegative` and `add_nat_simulate_add_int`. According to the transformation rules, variant clauses should be removed from transformed lemmas, but the function bodies were also incorrectly transformed from recursive implementations to simple `()`, which changes the semantic meaning. The original recursive structure that proves the lemmas through induction was completely removed."
prover/Prover.mlw,"INCORRECT: MEDIUM PRIORITY - Lemma transformation syntax error

The transformations of lemmas `is_atom_list_subst` and `is_procedure_tableau_subst` are incorrect. These are recursive lemmas that had variant clauses in the original code:

```
let rec lemma is_atom_list_subst (phil:fo_formula_list 'ls 'b)
  (sigma:'b -> (fo_term 'ls 'c)) : unit
  requires { is_atom_list phil }
  ensures { is_atom_list (subst_fo_formula_list phil subst_id_symbol sigma) }
  variant { size_fo_formula_list phil }
```

The transformation correctly removed the variant clause and changed to `let ghost`, but failed to preserve the `rec` keyword which is essential for recursive functions. The correct transformation should be:

```
let rec ghost is_atom_list_subst (phil:fo_formula_list 'ls 'b)
  (sigma:'b -> (fo_term 'ls 'c)) : unit
  requires { is_atom_list phil }
  ensures { is_atom_list (subst_fo_formula_list phil subst_id_symbol sigma) }
```

The same issue applies to `is_procedure_tableau_subst`. Without the `rec` keyword, these recursive ghost functions will not compile correctly."
prover/Unification.mlw,"INCORRECT: HIGH PRIORITY - Function variant clauses were removed from recursive functions

The transformation incorrectly removed variant clauses from recursive functions `power_rel_det`, `power_rel_additive`, `power`, and `power_fixed_point`. These are essential specifications for termination proofs and must be preserved according to the rules. Only lemma variant clauses should be removed during transformation, but function variant clauses must be kept.

For example:
- `power_rel_det` lost its `variant { n }` clause
- `power_rel_additive` lost its `variant { n }` clause  
- `power` lost its `variant { n }` clause
- `power_fixed_point` lost its `variant { n }` clause

These functions also had their functional implementations removed and replaced with `()`, which is incorrect - only lemma bodies should be transformed this way, not regular recursive functions."
tests/execute-tests.mlw,"INCORRECT: LOW PRIORITY - Function body was incorrectly modified beyond assertion removal

The transformation changed `let f (x: int) = assert {x > 0}` to `let f (x: int) = ()`, which removes the assertion but also changes the function's return behavior. The correct transformation should only remove the assertion annotation while preserving the function's essential structure, not replace the entire body with unit."
tests/lemma_functions.mlw,"INCORRECT: MEDIUM PRIORITY - Variant clause was incorrectly removed from lemma transformation. The variant clause ""variant { u-l }"" should be preserved in the transformed lemma as it's part of the specification."
verifythis_2016_matrix_multiplication/matrices.mlw,"INCORRECT: MEDIUM PRIORITY - Lemma transformation syntax error in block_mul_ij function

The function `block_mul_ij` was incorrectly transformed. It was changed from a proper lemma implementation to just `= ()`, but this function has a `variant { k }` clause and contains recursive logic that should be preserved as functional code. The variant clause was also incorrectly removed. This function appears to be a recursive lemma that should maintain its computational structure, not be reduced to an empty ghost function."
verifythis_2016_matrix_multiplication/matrices_ring_simp.mlw,"INCORRECT: HIGH PRIORITY - Assertion was incorrectly transformed to unit literal instead of being removed

The transformation at line 374 changed:
```
assert { e_mdl env m11 = e_mdl env gm11 }
```
to:
```
()
```

According to the transformation rules, assertions should be REMOVED entirely, not replaced with a unit literal `()`. The correct transformation should have completely removed this line."
verifythis_2016_matrix_multiplication/sum_extended.mlw,"INCORRECT: MEDIUM PRIORITY - Lemma transformation removed variant clauses that should be preserved in recursive lemmas

The transformations incorrectly removed the `variant { b - a }` and `variant { b - a }` clauses from the `sum_mult` and `sum_add` lemmas respectively. According to the rules, variant clauses should only be removed from transformed lemmas, but these are essential for proving termination of the original recursive structure and should be preserved even in the ghost function transformation."
imp/imp.mlw,"INCORRECT: HIGH PRIORITY - Variant clause was removed from recursive lemma transformation

The transformation incorrectly removed the `variant { e }` clause from the `eval_expr_functional` lemma. According to the rules, variant clauses from transformed lemmas should be removed, but this was originally a recursive lemma (`let rec lemma`) and the variant clause is essential for termination. When transforming recursive lemmas to ghost functions, the variant clause should be preserved if it's semantically important for the function specification.

Additionally, there's an assertion removal issue where `assert { mem v s.vars };` was removed from the functional code in the `symbolic_interp_cmd` function, but assertions within functional code bodies should only be removed if they are pure verification assertions, not if they might affect program semantics."
